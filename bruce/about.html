            It all started with a vision. To give the people of Kent the best boba that they have
            ever had. And with this vision, we created TruTea to meet our goals. What started as a simple
            idea, has turned into our way of giving back to our own community.

                Amy was the one who was the first one to come up with the idea of opening up a boba shop. Growing up
                as an Asian American, Amy has been exposed to both cultures, and realizes the unique experiences
                that Asian Americans go through in their lives. She fondly remembers drinking boba with her family and
                friends, and sees boba as more than just a drink. She believes that boba is a staple of Asian American culture, 
                bringing together people through a common experience.

                Michael grew up around boba all of his life. As an Asian American, he and Amy shared a common cultural background.
                They both realized that boba is a symbolic drink for many people like them, and the power it has to bring people
                together. Michael has opened up his own boba shop in the past, the name being ChaTime, and now has teamed up with
                Amy to start TruTea. He believes that everyone should know what good boba tastes like, and strives to make sure that
                he can meet this goal.
